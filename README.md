Temporal Sentiment Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Yelp Business Reviews
📌 Overview

This project analyzes 50,000 Yelp reviews (2005–2023) to uncover temporal sentiment trends, predict business decline, and classify user behavior. By combining NLP techniques with machine learning models, it demonstrates how review data can provide early warning systems for businesses and deeper insights into evolving customer behavior.

🎯 Key Features

Temporal Sentiment Analysis: Track how review sentiment changes over time.

User Behavior Classification: Identify long-term reviewer patterns and behavioral shifts.

Business Decline Prediction: Forecast early signs of business decline with high accuracy.

Hidden Sentiment Detection: Found that 14% of 5⭐ reviews contained hidden negative sentiment.

Impact of External Events: Showed how COVID-19 shifted focus to safety and delivery.

🛠️ Technologies & Methods

Data: Yelp Academic Dataset (50,000 reviews, 2005–2023)

NLP Techniques:

VADER, TextBlob for sentiment scoring

TF-IDF, LDA for topic modeling

Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC

Visualization: Sentiment distribution, temporal trends, PCA, feature importance

📊 Results

Business decline prediction accuracy: ~87%

User behavior classification accuracy: ~82%

Key Findings:

Sentiment decline occurs 6–9 months before rating drops

23% of active users became more critical post-2020

Urban businesses dominate the dataset → urban bias detected
